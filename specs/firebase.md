## Firebase Admin SDK.

### Your server environment and FCM

The server side of Firebase Cloud Messaging consists of two components:

1. The FCM backend provided by Google.
2. Your app server or other trusted server environment where your server logic runs, such as Cloud Functions for
   Firebase or other cloud environments managed by Google.
   Your app server or trusted server environment sends message requests to the FCM backend, which then routes messages
   to client apps running on users' devices.
